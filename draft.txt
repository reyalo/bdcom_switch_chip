Host A can send -> (Host C, Host D, Router Interface VLAN 100)
Host B can send -> (Host C, Host D, Router Interface VLAN 100)

Host C can send -> All
Host D can send -> All
Router Interface VLAN 100 can send -> All


Packet: Host A (192.168.1.2 Port 2) → Host B (192.168.1.3 Port 3)
Packet Type: L3 Routed IPv4 packet

Step-by-Step Flow
step0: Host A lookup its ARP table For Device B(192.168.1.3)
Arp not Found

Step 1: Host A sends ARP request to Gateway
Host A wants to talk to Host B

Its default gateway is 192.168.1.1 (Router on Port 10)

So it sends ARP request → Router replies

VLAN-based isolation does NOT block ARP to port 10 (bit=1)

ARP exchange succeeds



Step 2: Host A sends IP Packet
Host A sends L3 IP packet to Router

Host A find MAC of Host B(192.168.1.1) from its ARP table.

Frame:
SMAC: Host A
DMAC: Router Interface MAC
EtherType: 0x0800 
VLAN Tag: VLAN 100

switch checks forwarding from Port 2 → Port 10

Forwarded successfully

Step 3: Router Processes and Forwards
Router sees:
Router find Next-hop MAC for Host B(192.168.1.3)
Sends out new Ethernet frame on Port 3

New Frame:

SMAC: Router Interface MAC for VLAN 100
DMAC: Host B MAC
VLAN Tag: 100

switch(VLAN 100) checks forwarding from Port 10 → Port 3
Its Valid
Routed packet to Port 3


##############################################################################
Packet: Host A (192.168.1.2 Port 2) → Host B (192.168.1.3 Port 3)

Step 1: Host A sends ARP request for the Gateway

Host A wants to send to 192.168.1.3
But it's outside its ARP cache
Host A’s default gateway is 192.168.1.1 (Router on Port 10)

So it sends ARP Request: “MAC for 192.168.1.1?”

VLAN-based Isolation Behavior:

Port 2 bit = 0
Port 10 bit = 1

So 0 → 1 = allowed

Result:
ARP Request reaches the router on Port 10
Router responds with its MAC

Host A saves:
192.168.1.1 → MAC_Router
ARP exchange succeeds

Step 2: Host A sends L3 IP Packet to Host B via Router
Now Host A builds an L3 packet:

Ethernet Frame:
Field	Value
SMAC	Host A's MAC
DMAC	MAC of Router
EthType	0x0800 (IPv4)
VLAN Tag	VLAN 100
Payload	IP packet to 192.168.1.3

Packet goes from Port 2 → Port 10

VLAN-based isolation:

Port 2 bit = 0
Port 10 bit = 1

0 → 1 is allowed
Switch forwards to Port 10

Step 3: Router receives and processes the packet
Router does:

IP Lookup: 192.168.1.3
Resolves ARP: 192.168.1.3 → MAC_B
Creates new Ethernet frame for Layer 2

New Ethernet Frame (for egress to Port 3):
Field	Value
SMAC	Router MAC (VLAN 100 interface)
DMAC	MAC of Host B
VLAN Tag	VLAN 100
Payload	IP packet to 192.168.1.3

This goes from Router (Port 10) → Host B (Port 3)

VLAN-based isolation:
Port 10 bit = 1
Port 3 bit = 0

1 → 0 is allowed

Switch forwards to Port 3
